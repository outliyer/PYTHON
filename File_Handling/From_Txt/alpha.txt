### Points to Remember
1. Since humans are easy to manipulate and influence, trust nobody, including me. Believe in what you consider right.
2. I come up with all these theories, and who knows whether they are true or not.
3. I might exaggerate a bit, so understand what I want to say and forget the rest.
4. Please don't make fun of this because I put a lot of effort into typing, thinking, and expressing my thoughts.
5. Forgive me if I hurt anyone's feelings and do not share this with anyone.
6. I suck at spelling, so don't mind if you encounter errors.
7. I wrote everything I thought. It might be unrealistic, but I wanted to see how it would be if it were real.
8. This is for my future self to know how I feel now by reading my past thoughts.
9. I let you read this to know more about me. I might sound foolish, but that's fine by me.
10. What I mentioned below might seem like nonsense, so don't bother about it. I wrote it because I got bored and wanted to express my thoughts.

### UNFAIR
The matrix represents a system of control. We are trapped in our lives, at least that's what I think. It can be completely random or planned, or a coincidence—we never know. Why are classes divided based on status and caste? Why are individuals treated differently? Take Adani, for example. If he turns out to be a scam, the government plays a big part. If a commoner did such scams, it would be a nightmare. We have different rules for different people, such as men and women. I'm not against feminism or anything, but why the double standards?

### STORY OF THE UNBORN
Imagine we were born in an era with no boundaries, politics, power, money, or discrimination. We would live our lives freely, like early humans, without responsibilities, exploring new places and making new connections, like birds in the sky. But now we are civilized, evolved, and have far better lives, right? Not really. We have status, reputation, and finances that get in our way. We've lost the 'freedom of being ourselves.' We are not our real selves; we don't know ourselves until we are alone. We get easily influenced by others—that's how brands make money. Why would anyone buy a product for 5x its functionality unless influenced? That's what I mean by "fake people."

Next time you see a beautiful cat or bird on the street, don't act like you care if you would think twice before cooking it if you were a pure non-vegetarian. Thank God I'm not a fan of eating meat, though I eat it occasionally. Sometimes you have to abandon humanity to save your life, all for tasty food rich in calories and proteins. Okay, that was a bit exaggerated in the flow; never mind.

So, rule no.1 I set for myself is: Think logically before making any decisions. Buying a product for 5x the price that I never needed and acting satisfied won't make sense to me. It depends on the person. That's how I think about it.

### OUT OF REACH
Do you know what money is? It's just a piece of paper with no intrinsic value. They can print as much as they want. Guess what? We chase after it our whole lives without knowing what it is. People give up their lives for it. This is what I mean by "fake money." This is completely off-topic.

Now you wonder how a person can control all this. Think, who does the media work for? Why would someone admit they have control over the world? They want power, not fame. They are not celebrities or social media influencers who react to every trending topic without an invitation. No matter what, they will never reveal their identity. This is my theory; we never know if such people exist or not. It's completely out of reach for commoners.

### OLD MAN'S DREAM
The real question is, how can we get out of this mess? This is the most challenging part. Our parents are hard workers. My dad spends his life chasing money to survive. My family wants me to study hard, get a decent job, and make my life better. There's nothing wrong with that because this is how my parents grew up. This is what they expect from me. And here I am, a 19-year-old guy, not knowing what to do in life after finding out how the world works. Should I keep chasing money all my life to survive?

### PRICE TO BE PAID
I came up with a simple solution: instead of chasing money, I want to learn how to control my emotions, feelings, habits, greed, and desires. I don't want to be super rich; I just want peace in my life. For this, I need a minimal amount of money, so I should work on that soon. Getting obsessed with a girl who doesn't even know me—where does that idea come from? Probably from a romantic movie. We get influenced by movies. Ever since, I've reduced my time watching series and movies, especially romantic ones. It's okay to watch occasionally. I want to get rid of it.

One thing is for sure: freedom is not free anymore. We have to pay the price for it. If you don't care about what others think of your actions, you've already made it halfway. I can't pull off just yet.

### AT THE END
At the end of the day, I want to live peacefully, far out of reach from anyone, close to nature. I want to see the sky daily, hear the sound of water falling from a cliff, and explore different cultures before I die without any regrets. I know I might sound like I'm in a movie, but I don't care. I want to experience it. I hate taking responsibilities. I fear messing up, so I don't want to deal with it. I'm not responsible for anything, okay? It's such a pain. I don't know if I should overcome it or let it stay like this. 

Come on, I've already wasted half of my life studying things I probably won't use. I have the right to rest easy, right?
